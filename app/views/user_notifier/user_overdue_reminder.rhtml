Hey Journal writer, the following journals need your attention:

<% @journals.each{|journal_spec|
 journal = journal_spec[0]

You are receiving this email because you asked to be reminded to write in your
journal. We hope this is helping you stay up-to-date with your writing. If this
email is annoying and you don't want to see it again, you can turn off the
reminder preference on your profile page:
