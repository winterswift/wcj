<h1 class="nomargin">About Word Count Journal</h1>
<p>
Sometimes a little bit really does go a long way. In Word Count Journal, by gradually building up your writing stamina and discipline, you will see just how easy it is to get a whole lot done. By simply writing a set number of words each day, every day, you will write a whopping 66,795 words at the end of one calendar year. Little by little, through the power of series, the total of your written words will add up to more words than contained in the average novel.
</p>

<p>
It is hard to believe but 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 ... + 364 + 365 = 66,795. Just like the Confucian saying that the longest trip begins with the first step, your journal journey begins with the first word.

<h2>
Features
</h2>
<p>
Here's an overview of the features that make Word Count Journal interesting.
</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Journals</strong>: You can create any number of journals, deciding for each, how long they will be (one week, one month, one year!) Make your journal private, or share it with the world. You decide.</li>
<li><strong>Entries</strong>: The application will tell you how many words you should write in each entry, but if you want to break the rules, feel free to do so. But try to give the extra-word-a-day model a try; it creates a nice writing rhythm.</li>
<li><strong>Pictures</strong>: A picture is worth a thousand words. Add a picture to your entries, and your own profile.</li>
<li><strong>Comments</strong>: If you allow your journals to be public, others can provide comments, and we'll email you when that happens. Comment on the entries of others, and subscribe to comment notification when the conversation gets interesting!</li>
<li><strong>Groups</strong>: Don't journal alone! Create a group (public or private) and enjoy the companionship of fellow journalers! Particularly useful for families, friends, and schools. You can create a public group and anyone can join.  If you want your group to only be your friends, make it private.  The group owner invites each member to the private group.  If you put a private journal in a private group, only the group members can see it.</li>
<li><strong>Favorites</strong>: Finding it difficult to follow just those journals you like? Add them to your Favorites list, and be visually informed when new entries have been made.</li>
<li><strong>RSS Feeds</strong>: Just like any good weblog tool, Word Count Journal let's others follow your journals via RSS subscription feeds.</li>
<li><strong>Your profile</strong>: Your profile contains a username, a short description, a picture and your preferences regarding email reminders and news updates from WCJ. Non-public information in your profile include your email address (so we can contact you about important WCJ issues) and your time-zone (so we can figure out when "today" is for you, wherever you might be in the world.</li>
</ul>
