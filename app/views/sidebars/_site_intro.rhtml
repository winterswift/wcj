    including some private school groups.</p>

    <p>We have written a total of <strong><%= format_number(site_statistics[:words]) %> words</strong> &ndash; <strong><%= format_number((site_statistics[:words] / 3000000.0) * 100) %>%</strong> of the way to the <strong>3 million word milestone</strong>!</p>
